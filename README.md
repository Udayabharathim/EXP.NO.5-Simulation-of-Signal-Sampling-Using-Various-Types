# EXP.NO.5-Simulation-of-Signal-Sampling-Using-Various-Types


## AIM:
    Simulation of Signal Sampling Using Various Types such as
    i) Ideal Sampling
    ii) Natural Sampling
    iii) Flat Top Sampling

# SOFTWARE REQUIRED:
    Google Collab

# ALGORITHMS:
1. Generate a sine wave signal
2. Create impulse train for ideal sampling
3. Create rectangular pulse train for natural and flat-top sampling
4. Multiply the signal with sampling pulses
5. Plot original and sampled signals
